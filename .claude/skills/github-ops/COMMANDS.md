## Fetching PR Data

### Get unresolved review threads (GraphQL)

Use inline values in the query to avoid encoding issues:

```bash
gh api graphql -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" -f query='query { repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") { pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) { title url reviewThreads(first: 100) { nodes { id isResolved isOutdated path line startLine comments(first: 10) { nodes { id databaseId body author { login } createdAt } } } } } } }'
```

Filter for unresolved threads with jq:

```bash
... | jq '{
  title: .data.repository.pullRequest.title,
  url: .data.repository.pullRequest.url,
  unresolved_threads: [.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)]
}'
```

**IMPORTANT**: Keep the GraphQL query on a single line to avoid shell parsing issues.

### Extract comment from discussion URL

- URL format: `pull/438#discussion_r2673798141`
- Comment database ID: Remove "r" prefix → `2673798141`
- Query: `gh api -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/2673798141`

### Get recent comments (sorted)

```bash
gh api -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments | jq 'sort_by(.created_at) | reverse | .[0:10]'
```

## Creating Reviews

### Create a pending review with inline comments

````bash
cat <<'JSONEOF' | gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/reviews --method POST -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" --input -
{
  "body": "Review summary here",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.py",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "Comment body here. Use ```suggestion\ncode here\n``` for suggested changes."
    }
  ]
}
JSONEOF
````

### Inline comment fields

- `path`: File path relative to repo root (required)
- `line`: Line number in the file (required for single-line comments)
- `side`: `"RIGHT"` for new code, `"LEFT"` for removed code (required)
- `body`: Comment text, supports markdown and ```suggestion blocks (required)
- `start_line` + `start_side`: For multi-line comments
- **Note**: `position` is deprecated — always use `line` + `side`

## Responding to Reviews

### Reply to existing review comment

Use the `/replies` endpoint — do NOT use `in_reply_to` on the create comment endpoint:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies \
  --method POST \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  -f body="Reply text"
```

### Submit a pending review

**Only do this after user confirmation**:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/reviews/REVIEW_ID/events \
  --method POST \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  -f event="REQUEST_CHANGES"
```

Use `"COMMENT"`, `"APPROVE"`, or `"REQUEST_CHANGES"` for the event field.

## Thread Management

### Resolve review thread (GraphQL mutation)

Requires the token to have Repository > Contents: Read & Write.

```bash
gh api graphql -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```
